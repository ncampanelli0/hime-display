# Source Engine MDL Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added full support for Source Engine .mdl model files (from games like Left 4 Dead 2, Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, etc.) to Hime Display.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Parser Integration
- **Package**: `source-mdl` (v0.2.4)
- **Purpose**: Parses Source Engine MDL, VTX, and VVD files
- **Installation**: Successfully installed via npm

### 2. SourceEngineManager Class
**File**: `src/renderer/display/modelManagers/SourceEngineManager.js`

**Features**:
- Extends `ModelManager3D` base class
- Loads and parses .mdl, .vtx, and .vvd files
- Converts Source Engine mesh data to Three.js geometry
- Manages animation sequences
- Handles bodygroups (model part variations)
- Supports skin/texture variants
- Mouse tracking for head following
- Configurable outline effects and orbit controls

**Key Methods**:
- `loadModel()` - Loads MDL files and converts to Three.js
- `_playSequence()` - Plays animation sequences by index or name
- `_setBodyGroup()` - Changes model parts
- `_setSkin()` - Changes texture variants
- `_applyAnimationFrame()` - Applies animation data (placeholder for future enhancement)

### 3. Animation Utilities
**Files**: 
- `src/renderer/display/utils/mdl/AnimationManager.js`
- `src/renderer/display/utils/mdl/Monitor.js`

**AnimationManager Features**:
- Sequence playback control (play, pause, stop, resume)
- Animation speed control
- Loop mode control
- Frame-based animation timing
- Sequence information queries

**Monitor Classes**:
- `SequenceMonitor` - Tracks animation state changes
- `BodyGroupMonitor` - Tracks bodygroup changes
- `SkinMonitor` - Tracks skin/texture changes

### 4. Application Integration
**File**: `src/renderer/display/Application.js`

**Changes**:
- Imported `SourceEngineManager`
- Registered as `modelManagers.SourceEngine`
- Automatic routing for `modelType: "SourceEngine"`

### 5. API Commands
**File**: `src/main/api/CommandHandler.js`

**New API Actions**:
- `playSequence` - Play animation by index or name
- `stopSequence` - Stop current animation
- `setBodyGroup` - Change model parts
- `setSkin` - Change texture variant
- `setSequenceSpeed` - Control playback speed
- `setSequenceLoop` - Enable/disable looping

**Example Usage**:
```json
{
  "action": "playSequence",
  "data": {
    "sequenceName": "run_all"
  }
}
```

    "entranceFile": "file:///path/to/survivor_namvet.mdl"

## Common Use Cases

### 1. AI Character System
Use L4D2 survivors as AI characters with dynamic animations:
```python
# Play idle when not speaking
await client.post({"action": "playSequence", "data": {"sequenceName": "idle01"}})

# Run animation when moving
await client.post({"action": "playSequence", "data": {"sequenceName": "run_all"}})
```

### 2. Game Character Display
Display your favorite game characters on desktop:
- Load Team Fortress 2 class models
- Play signature animations and taunts
- Switch between different weapons (bodygroups)

### 3. Streaming Overlay
Use as animated overlay for streams:
- Control via OBS browser source
- Trigger animations based on events
- WebSocket integration for real-time control

## Known Limitations

1. **Basic Animation**: Current implementation has placeholder for bone transformations. Full skeletal animation parsing needed for complex movements.

2. **Textures**: Models may appear with default materials if .vmt/.vtf files aren't present or properly referenced.

3. **Performance**: High-poly Source Engine models may impact performance. Consider using lower LOD models.

4. **File Requirements**: All three files (.mdl, .vtx, .vvd) must be present in the same directory.

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Full bone animation system
- [ ] Texture loading and material system
- [ ] Facial flex animation support

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Physics simulation (ragdoll)
- [ ] Attachment system for weapons
- [ ] LOD (Level of Detail) support

### Low Priority
- [ ] Particle effect system
- [ ] Advanced shader support
- [ ] Source Engine physics materials

## Testing Recommendations

### Test with these L4D2 models:
1. **Survivors**:
   - `survivor_namvet.mdl` (Bill)
   - `survivor_teenangst.mdl` (Zoey)
   - `survivor_biker.mdl` (Francis)
   - `survivor_manager.mdl` (Louis)

2. **Common sequences to test**:
   - `idle01`, `idle02` - Basic idle
   - `walk_all` - Walking
   - `run_all` - Running
   - `crouch_idle` - Crouching
   - `reload` - Reloading weapon

### Test API commands:
```bash
# Test sequence playback
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"playSequence","data":{"sequenceName":"idle01"}}'

# Test speed control
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"setSequenceSpeed","data":{"speed":1.5}}'

# Test stop
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"stopSequence","data":{}}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Model won't load
- Verify all three files (.mdl, .vtx, .vvd) are present
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure `modelType: "SourceEngine"` is set

### White/gray model
- Missing texture files (.vmt, .vtf)
- Texture paths may need adjustment
- This is expected behavior without textures

### Animation not playing
- Check sequence name spelling (case-sensitive)
- Try using `sequenceIndex` instead
- Some models have limited sequences
